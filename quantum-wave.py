    Constructs the quantum circuit based on parameters I discovered using a genetic algorithm (GA), to create robust interference patterns.

    Key points:
    - We start from a known initial state configuration.
    - 'apply_phase' determines whether we apply a phase gate. This encodes a '1' bit if True,
      and '0' bit if False.
    - 'phase_angle', 'steps', 'rz_angle', and 'ry_angle' are all parameters chosen so that
      small differences (applying or not applying the phase) become large, easily distinguishable
      differences in final measurement outcomes.
    - The sequence of gates (H, CNOT, CZ, CRY, etc.) is known beforehand by both "Alice" and "Bob".
      This is part of the predetermined protocol.

    The circuit ends by measuring certain qubits in the computational basis.
    The result is an interference pattern that encodes which bit was present ('0' or '1').

    This is not "clasical communication" because:
    - All operations and the measurement basis are agreed upon before any encoding occurs.
    - The known plaintext "42" at the start of every message is a pre-shared reference.
      Bob uses it to determine a decoding threshold. This reference is part of the protocol,
      not extra information gained on the fly.
