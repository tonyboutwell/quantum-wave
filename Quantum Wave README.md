Quantum Interference-Based Communication Simulation Using Qiskit and Python

Overview:
This repository explores how a carefully pre-arranged quantum protocol can transform tiny local phase differences into clear, distinguishable interference patterns on the receiving end. By starting with a shared quantum resource and a known plaintext calibration, we demonstrate a scenario where one party (Alice) encodes bits by applying minimal phase changes, and the other party (Bob), following the agreed-upon strategy, can decode these bits with high accuracy — often 100% — even under substantial simulated noise and with fewer measurement shots.

This simulation provides a platform for testing the theoretical boundaries of quantum interference and exploring how predetermined conditions and protocols influence the ability to distinguish states encoded by subtle local operations.

Simulation Highlights

1. Pre-Shared Protocol and Known Plaintext Calibration:
   Before the experiment, Alice and Bob agree on:
   * The exact quantum circuit structure, including entangling operations, rotations, and the quantum walk steps.
   * The measurement basis Bob will use.
   * A known plaintext segment (“42”) that appears at the start of every transmitted message.
This known plaintext acts as a calibration key. By examining these known bits, Bob determines a decoding threshold that he applies to the rest of the message, ensuring seamless interpretation without further communication or post-hoc adjustments.

2. Encoding with Phase Changes:
Alice encodes each bit of her message by applying or not applying a small phase shift. Although initially a subtle difference, the chosen unitaries and interference steps cause these small phase shifts to produce distinctly different outcome probabilities on Bob’s side.

3. Quantum Walk and Interference Amplification:
Bob performs a quantum walk and other agreed-upon rotations that “amplify” the impact of Alice’s phase choices. This amplification turns what would be negligible differences into large, easily measurable variations in the distribution of certain measurement outcomes.

4. Measurement and Decoding:
After running the circuit, Bob measures the designated qubits. By comparing the resulting probability distributions to those predicted by the known plaintext segment, he decodes the message. The chosen parameters and strategies often yield perfect decoding accuracy, even in the presence of significant noise and with relatively few measurement shots (e.g., ~4200 shots).

5. Robustness Under Noise and Low Shot Counts:
   The method’s robustness is demonstrated by:
   * High accuracy under multiple-percent levels of depolarizing and amplitude damping noise.
   * Near-perfect decoding with significantly reduced measurement shots, showing that the interference-driven signal is strong and not easily washed out by statistical fluctuations.

Running the Experiment
1. Requirements:
   * Python 3
   * Qiskit (for quantum simulation)
   * Matplotlib (for visualizing outcome distributions and interference patterns)

2. Procedure:
   * Run the provided Python script.
   * The script encodes a secret message prefixed by “42” (the calibration plaintext).
   * It applies the agreed-upon quantum walk and rotations, simulates noise, measures qubits, and determines a threshold from the known plaintext bits.
   * The script then decodes the full message and prints the accuracy, often showing excellent results.

3. Visualization:
The code generates a chart that illustrates the average outcome probabilities for known ‘0’ vs. known ‘1’ bits, making it clear how a minimal phase change leads to a significant difference in measured distributions.

In Summary:
This repository provides a simulation environment to explore and test how a well-crafted quantum protocol, involving known calibration data and a finely tuned set of unitaries, can reliably convert subtle local operations into distinguishable patterns in measurement outcomes. Through this approach, the simulation demonstrates impressive robustness against noise and limited shot counts, offering insights into the potential of quantum interference as a powerful tool for encoding and decoding information under fully predetermined conditions.
