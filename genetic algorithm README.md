## Parameter Optimization Framework
Tries different circuit configurations and finds those that yield the best contrast (margin) between ‘0’ and ‘1’ states. 

#### Key Ideas of This Approach:

Parameter Space:
Define a parameter set that includes:
 * Rotation angles (e.g., phase_angle, extra rotations like rz, ry).
 * Number of steps in the quantum walk.
 * Possibly different circuit constructions or gates.
 * You can add or remove parameters as you see fit.


#### Fitness Function (Objective):
The GA needs a metric to decide which parameter sets are “better.” We’ll use the margin or the training accuracy on the known plaintext bits as our fitness metric. Higher margin or accuracy = better solution.

#### Genetic Operators:
 * Crossover: Mix parameters from two good solutions.
 * Mutation: Randomly tweak parameters to explore new regions of parameter space.

#### Cataloging Candidates:
We’ll store the best solutions found, so you can revisit them later. For example, we can keep a list of the top 10 parameter sets that achieved the best margins.

Important Note:
This code will take a while to run if you set large populations or many generations, due to Qiskit simulations. Consider starting with small populations and fewer generations, then scale up once everything works.
